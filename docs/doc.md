# DevOps Course - Project Documentation

## Introduction

This document captures the work completed as part of the DevOps course (024717050608).
The focus of the course is to build a small application as a team of 3 people, 
set up continuous integration/deployment and automate supporting tasks such as documentation generation, testing and code analysis. 
The documentation is versioned and will evolve as the project progresses.

# Account Management Frontend

This is a **React + Vite** frontend application for managing bank accounts.  
It allows users to:

- View all accounts and their balances
- Create new accounts
- Deposit, withdraw, and transfer money

The frontend communicates with a backend REST API exposed under `/api/v1`.

## Routing:
- `/` → Accounts list
- `/new` → Create account form
- `/accounts/:name` → Account detail view

---

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/danielshahini/DevOpsFHV.git
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   By default, the app runs on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
